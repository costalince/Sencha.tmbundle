This bundle can be used for both Ext JS and Sencha Touch. It is compatible with Ext JS 3.x and above, with limited compatibility with Ext JS 2.x.

Most of the snippets revolve around creating classes using Ext.extend. Each snippet has placeholders for JSDoc wherever appropriate.

The easiest way to see what's available is to simply open the bundle up via the Bundles -> Bundle Editor -> Show Bundle Editor menu.
